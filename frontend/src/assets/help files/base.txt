Import Console Base Command

Syntax: base <full-path>
Example: base /Persons/Genesis/Abraham

The leading slash and capitalization are optional. The base theme in the example is Abraham.
Abraham has a parent Theme, Genesis. Genesis is a child of the Persons theme.

Discussion: The "base" command sets a specific Theme as the base Theme for the session.
Users can create new Themes and new Citations attached to an open Theme. A
user can open a subtheme, show its attached Themes and Citations, and create
new themes and citations. A user cannot close the base theme, but they can set
a new base theme.

Narrative: The user can type the path of the Theme, but a shorthand way to obtain
the path of the Theme is to navigate through the Theme Tree to the theme they would like
to set as the base Theme. They can right-click the Theme folder and select "Copy" from
the context menu. Then in the Import Console, right-click the command line and Paste the 
theme. The path will appear in the command line. Base Themes cannot be closed, but a
new base Theme can be set by the user.
