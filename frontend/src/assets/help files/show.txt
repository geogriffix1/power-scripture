Import Console Show Command

Syntax: show, show t[hemes], show c[itations]
Examples: show, show t, show cit, show th, show themes

Shows the contents of the open Theme. A base Theme must be set for the session.
Once a base Theme is set it becomes the open Theme until a different theme is opened.

The contents are shown in the form of a list. If the "themes" qualifier is added,
only the child themes are displayed. If the "citations" qualifier is supplied, only the
citations are displayed. If there is no qualifier then both are displayed. Themes are
displayed first followed by Citations.

Only the Name and the Description of each child theme are displayed. Contents of child
themes are not displayed.

The Description and Citation label of all Citations in the theme are displayed.
Citations of child themes are not displayed.

The Citation label is a list of all scriptures being cited in the citation in the form
of scripture ranges separated by commas. Verse ranges are displayed in Bible order,
which is the order in which books, chapters, and verses naturally appear in the Bible.
One example of a scripture range would be John 3:16-19.

A scripture range, on output, is confined to one chapter. One citation can contain any
number of individual ranges. The show command will show all ranges in the citation,
separated by commas.
