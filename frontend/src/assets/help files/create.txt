Creates a new Theme or Citation as a child of the Open Theme. A Base Theme must be
established or creation will fail. Enter the word "create" followed by the word "theme"
or "citation", which can be shortened to one or more characters in length.

A theme must have a name. A name can be up to 45 characters long, but should be
considerably shorter than that. Capitalization matters in the theme name. Theme names cannot have
slashes or quotation marks in them. Descriptions are optional. They begin with a quotation mark.
Ending quotation marks are optional.

A citation has a description, followed by a list of scripture ranges. The description is
optional and it begins and ends with quotation marks. Citation ranges are designations
of scripture using book, chapter, start verse, and end verse. Multiple ranges can be
used separated by commas.

Chapter names must be spelled correctly, or a three-character code unique to each book
can be entered in place of the chapter name.

For a complete list of book names and codes use "help books". Book names and codes can
be copied and pasted.

Once created, a theme can be opened like any other theme. Open Themes can serve as
parent Themes to Themes and Citations. Created Themes and Citations are not permanent
until they are saved. The "save" command saves all created Themes and Citations which
have not already been saved.
