Import Console Close Command

Syntax: close

Closes the open Theme and opens the Theme previous to the open Theme. The Base Theme cannot
be closed.

Example: Assume the following path exists - /Persons/Genesis/Abraham/Isaac/Jacob

We set the base theme as Persons/Genesis, then we open Abraham. Later we open the subpath
"isaac/jacob". When we close Jacob, Abraham becomes the open Theme. This is because
we earlier opened Jacob directly from Abraham without opening Isaac.

Abraham is the open Theme. When we close Abraham, Genesis becomes open because Genesis
was open when we opened Abraham. Any attempt to close Genesis will be unsuccessful
because Genesis is the base Theme that we set. We can set a different base Theme using
the "Base" command.

Opening and closing Themes is how we traverse the Theme tree in the import console.
