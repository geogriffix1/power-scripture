Import Console Open Command

Syntax open <theme>, open <subpath>
Examples: open abraham, open abraham/isaac

Sets a new open theme from the subthemes. The first example sets Abraham as the open theme.
The second example sets Isaac as the open theme.

Discussion: An open theme is a theme which has already been created. Only Themes which are
descended from the currently open theme can be opened with the open command. Use the base
command to set a new base theme, which would automatically open it. Only one theme can be
open at a time.

The user can show the Themes and Citations that are the immediate children of the Theme that
is open. A user can create new themes and citations which become the children of the the
open theme. Created Themes can be opened and even before they are saved.
