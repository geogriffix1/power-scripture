Import Console Reset Command

Syntax: reset

The "Reset" command resets all created Themes and Citations which have not already been
saved. New Themes and Citations which are not already saved are removed. They have
effectively been deleted except that they were never saved in the first place.
A new base register cannot be established until all created Themes and Citations
are either saved or reset.
